# Smart Assistant Project

This project uses Python to run an AI-powered assistant that connects to a **Bluetooth speaker** and a **camera**. It requires a virtual environment and some Python dependencies.

### 1. Clone the repository (if not already done):
   ``` 
   git clone https://github.com/Chewrs/EyeTalk.git 
   ```
   ```
   cd EyeTalk
   ```

### 2. Create a virtual environment:    
```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4. Connect Bluetooth speaker and camera:
   - Make sure your device is paired and connected.
   - Ensure the camera is plugged in and accessible (e.g., via /dev/video0 on Linux).
